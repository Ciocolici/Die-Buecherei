# Die Bücherei

A C# Console App developed as an exercise during my retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung) at Lutz + Grub Academy. The application simulates a library system for managing the lending of different media types: books, software, and videos.

## Features

- Object-oriented class hierarchy (base classes and inheritance)
- Lending, returning, and availability checks for each media type
- Management of overdue returns
- Customer system with ratings

## How to Run

To run the Console App directly, launch `Die Buecherei.exe` located in `bin/Release/net6.0`.

**Note:** The application is in German.

**The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.**
