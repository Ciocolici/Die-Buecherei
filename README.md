# Die-Buecherei
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A C# (CSharp) Console App project. My first, actually. It asks the user about the weather, and depending on the answer(s), it gives recommendations on what to wear. 

Open "Die Buecherei.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Die Buecherei.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".
